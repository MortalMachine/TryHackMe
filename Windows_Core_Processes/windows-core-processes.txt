Windows core processes

1. System
 - C:\Windows\system32\Ntoskrnl.exe (but could be another loaded device driver)
 - A system thread that exists in OS-reserved memory space.
 - Runs only in kernel mode
 - PID 4 always
 - User account is NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM (aka Local System)
 - Has no parent process
 - 1 instance only
 - Starts at computer boot time
 - Runs in System Idle Process (0). The 0 indicates Session 0.
 
2. Session Manager Subsystem
 - C:\Windows\system32\smss.exe
 - Responsible for creating new sessions
 - Is the first user-mode process started by the kernel.
 - Starts the kernel mode and user mode of the Windows subsystem (win32k.sys kernel mode, winsrv.dll user mode, csrss.exe user mode).
   - Starts wininit.exe and csrss.exe in Session 0, and winlogon.exe and csrss.exe in Session 1.
 - Also responsible for creating environment variables, virtual memory paging files and starts winlogon.exe.
 - Parent process smss.exe PID 4
 - Only 1 running process
 - User is SYSTEM
 
3. Client Server Runtime Process
 - C:\Windows\system32\csrss.exe
 - User-mode side of the Windows subsystem
 - Responsible for the Win32 console window, process thread creation/deletion, making Windows API available to other processes, mapping drive letters, and handling Windows shutdown process.
 - For each instance, csrsrv.dll, basesrv.dll, and winsrv.dll are loaded (along with others)
 - Runs in Session 0 and 1
 - Parent process "Non-existent process ($PID$)" due to smss.exe self-terminating after child process creation.
 - 2+ running instances
 - User is SYSTEM

4. Windows Initialization Process
 - C:\Windows\system32\wininit.exe
 - Responsible for launching services.exe, lsass.exe, and lsaiso.exe (if Credential Guard is enabled) with Session 0.
 - Parent process "Non-existent process ($PID$)"
 - 1 running instance
 - User is SYSTEM
 
5. Service Control Manager
 - C:\Windows\system32\services.exe
 - Responsible to handle system services: loading services, interacting with services, starting/ending services, etc.
 - Maintains database that can be queried with sc.exe.
 - Information regarding services is stored in the registry HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services
 - Child processes: svchost.exe, spoolsv.exe, msmpeng.exe, dllhost.exe, and more.
 - Parent process wininit.exe
 - Session 0
 - 1 running instance
 - User is SYSTEM

6. Service Host
 - C:\Windows\system32\svchost.exe
 - Responsible for hosting and managing Windows services. Services running in this process are implemented as DLLs.
 - Malware will masquerade as this process or get it to install/call a malicious DLL.
 - Parent process services.exe
 - Has many instances, normally of command line form "\C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe -k <DLL name> [OPTIONS]"
   - The -k option should always be present.
 - User varies (e.g. SYSTEM, Network Service, Local Service, the logged in user)

7. Local Security Authority Subsystem Service
 - C:\Windows\System32\lsass.exe
 - Responsible for enforcing the security policy.
 - Uses authentication packages specified in HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa.
 - Parent process wininit.exe
 - 1 running instance
 - User is SYSTEM

8. Windows Logon
 - C:\Windows\System32\winlogon.exe
 - Responsible for handling the Secure Attention Sequence (SAS) i.e. CTRL+ALT+DELETE key combination for entering username & password.
 - Also responsible for locking screen, running screensaver, and loading the user profile by loading the user's NTUSER.DAT into HKCU. Userinit.exe loads the user's shell.
 - Parent process "Non-existent process ($PID$)"
 - 1+ running instance (additional instances occur as new user sessions are created)
 - Session 1
 - Only 1 shell value in the registry: explorer.exe

9. Windows Explorer
 - C:\Windows\explorer.exe
 - Gives the user access to their folders and files, and functionality to other features such as Start Menu and Taskbar.
 - Userinit.exe exits after spawning explorer.exe.
 - Parent process "Non-existent process ($PID$)"
 - 1 session for each interactively logged-in user
 - User is the logged-in userhttps://tryhackme.com/room/btwindowsinternals
 - Outbound TCP/IP connections would be unusual
 
Processes unique to Windows 10 not detailed here:
runtimebroker.exe
taskhostw.exe (formerly taskhost.exe and taskhostex.exe)
